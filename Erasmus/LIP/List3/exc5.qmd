title: Testing Edgecases

# Infeasible Start

```{python}
from mip import Model, maximize

m = Model()

x1 = m.add_var(lb = 0) # variables
x2 = m.add_var(lb = 0)

m += x1 + x2 <= 2
m += 2 * x1 + 2 * x2 >= 2 # constraints

m.objective = maximize(x1 - x2)

m.optimize()
```

We notice no errors which looks promising.

```{python}
x = [x1.x, x2.x] # get values, not objects
print(f"x: {x}")
```

This is a correct solution which brings us to a conclusion that
pythonmip correctly handles infeasible start edgecase.

# Unboudedness

```{python}
m = Model()

x1 = m.add_var(lb = 0)
x2 = m.add_var(lb = 0)

m += -x1 + x2 <= 1
m += x2 <= 5

m.objective = maximize(2 * x1 + x2)

m.optimize()
```

Pythonmip correctly finds that a problem is unbounded.Let's 
see if the variables have been changed.

```{python}
x = [x1.x, x2.x]
print(f"x: {x}")
```

Worth noting: variables get set to None whenever pythonmip 
identifies an unbounded problem.

# Infinite Solutions

```{python}
m = Model()

x1 = m.add_var(lb = 0)
x2 = m.add_var(lb = 0)

m += 5 * x1 + 10 * x2 <= 60
m += 4 * x1 + 4 * x2 <= 40

m.objective = maximize(x1 + x2)
```

We can already see that one of the constraints is a multiple 
of the objective function, so there's a big chance to have 
an entire face of solutions. We're interested in seeing which 
solution the algorithm will give us.

```{python}
m.optimize()

x = [x1.x, x2.x]
print(f"x: {x}")
```

So pythonmip just gives us the first seen solution.

# The model in matrix standard form

Let's take the previous problem

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 10 \cr
4 & 4
\end{bmatrix}, 
b = 
\begin{bmatrix}
60 \cr
40
\end{bmatrix}, 
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
{x[0]}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
